Here's a song about flowers:

**Title:** "Petals of Joy

**Verse 1:**
In the garden of dreams, where love resides
A colorful world of beauty, where hearts abide
Roses red, like passionate hearts that beat
Lilies pure, like souls that seek retreat
Sunflowers bright, like smiles that shine so free
Daisies dancing, wild and carelessly

**Chorus:**
Flowers of joy, like petals in the air
Fragrant as love, beyond compare
In their beauty, we find our glee
Flowers of joy, set our hearts free

**Verse 2:**
Tulips sway, like lovers in a gentle breeze
Violets whisper, secrets only known to trees
Daffodils trumpet, hope eternal and bright
Lilacs whisper low, of memories so tight
Orchids exotic, like dreams that unfold
Carnations sweet, like memories to hold

**Chorus:**
Flowers of joy, like petals in the air
Fragrant as love, beyond compare
In their beauty, we find our glee
Flowers of joy, set our hearts free

**Bridge:**
In every bloom, a story's told
Of love, of life, of memories to hold
In every petal, a heart sing
A symphony of joy, that echoes and clings

**Chorus:**
Flowers of joy, like petals in the air
Fragrant as love, beyond compare
In their beauty, we find our glee
Flowers of joy, set our hearts free
