Here's a song about John Abraham:

**Title:** "The Action Hero"

**Verse 1:**
In the world of Bollywood, where heroes roam free
There's one man who stands tall, with a physique to see
John Abraham, the hunk, with a heart of gold
A hero on screen, with a story to be told

**Chorus:**
He's the action hero, with a passion so bright
Fighting for justice, with all his might
From Dhoom to Force, he's made his mark
John Abraham, the hero, in the dark

**Verse 2:**
From romantic comedies, to intense dramas too
John's proven his range, with a versatility anew
With a smile that kills, and a body to die for
He's the perfect package, that Bollywood adores

**Chorus:**
He's the action hero, with a passion so bright
Fighting for justice, with all his might
From Dhoom to Force, he's made his mark
John Abraham, the hero, in the dark

**Bridge:**
With a heart that beats, for the ones in need
John's philanthropy, is a noble deed
Supporting causes, that make a difference too
John Abraham, the hero, with a heart that's true

**Chorus:**
He's the action hero, with a passion so bright
Fighting for justice, with all his might
From Dhoom to Force, he's made his mark
John Abraham, the hero, in the dark

**Outro:**
John Abraham, the man, with a hero's heart
A Bollywood legend, from the very start
With a career spanning, decades of fame
John Abraham, the action hero, with a name.

I hope you enjoy this song!
