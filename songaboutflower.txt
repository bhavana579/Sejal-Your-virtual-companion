Here's a song about a flower:

**Title:** "Petals of Love"

**Verse 1:**
In the garden of dreams, I found you
A delicate beauty, with a gentle hue
Your petals soft as silk, your scent so sweet
You stole my heart, with your gentle beat

**Chorus:**
Oh, flower of love, you bloom in my heart
A symbol of passion, from the very start
In your beauty, I am lost
Forever with you, my love will never be frost

**Verse 2:**
Like a ray of sunshine, you brighten up my life
Your beauty is unmatched, a work of art in strife
Your colors vibrant, your spirit free
You remind me of the beauty, that's meant to be

**Chorus:**
Oh, flower of love, you bloom in my heart
A symbol of passion, from the very start
In your beauty, I am lost
Forever with you, my love will never be frost

**Bridge:**
Just like the seasons, our love will grow
Through every storm, our love will glow
In your petals, I'll forever stay
Forever with you, come what may

**Chorus:**
Oh, flower of love, you bloom in my heart
A symbol of passion, from the very start
In your beauty, I am lost
Forever with you, my love will never be frost

**Outro:**
In the garden of dreams, I'll find you again
Where love will bloom, and our hearts will entwine
In the beauty of your petals, I'll remain
Forever with you, my love, my flower of love.
