Here are 10 important operating system questions and answers:

**1. What is an Operating System (OS)?**

Answer: An Operating System (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services to computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and user-level applications.

**2. What are the main functions of an Operating System?**

Answer: The main functions of an Operating System are:

* Process Management: Managing the creation, execution, and termination of processes.
* Memory Management: Managing the allocation and deallocation of memory for running programs.
* File Management: Managing the creation, deletion, and modification of files.
* Input/Output (I/O) Management: Managing input/output operations between devices and programs.
* Security: Providing mechanisms for controlling access to computer resources.

**3. What is the difference between a Monolithic Kernel and a Microkernel?**

Answer: A Monolithic Kernel is a single large program that contains all operating system services, whereas a Microkernel is a small core that provides basic services and relies on external modules for additional services.

**4. What is a Process?**

Answer: A Process is a program in execution, including the current activity, memory, and system resources allocated to it. It is a unit of work that is being executed by the CPU.

**5. What is a Thread?**

Answer: A Thread is a lightweight process that shares the same memory space as other threads in the same process. It is a unit of execution that can be scheduled by the operating system.

**6. What is Deadlock? How can it be prevented?**

Answer: Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource. It can be prevented by using resource ordering, banker's algorithm, and avoiding circular waits.

**7. What is Paging and Segmentation?**

Answer: Paging is a memory management technique that divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called pages, while Segmentation is a technique that divides a program into logical segments or modules.

**8. What is Virtual Memory?**

Answer: Virtual Memory is a memory management technique that uses a combination of physical memory and secondary storage (hard disk) to provide a large address space for programs.

**9. What is Multitasking and Multiprocessing?**

Answer: Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks concurrently, while Multiprocessing is the use of multiple processors to execute tasks concurrently.

**10. What is a System Call?**

Answer: A System Call is a request made by a program to the operating system to perform a specific task, such as process creation, file management, or I/O operations.
